1. Game Representation:
Create a representation of the game board (3x3 grid for Tic-Tac-Toe).
Design a function to display the current state of the board.
2. Player Input:
Implement a function to take input from the human player.
Validate the input to ensure it's within the board range and not already filled.
3. AI Implementation:
Use the Minimax algorithm to create the AI player.
Define functions for maximizing and minimizing players (Max and Min).
Develop a function to evaluate the game state and assign scores (win, lose, draw).
Create the Minimax function that recursively computes the best move.
4. Game Loop:
Start a loop for the game.
Alternate between the human and AI player turns until the game ends (win, lose, draw).
Display the board after each move.
5. Game Over:
Implement a function to check for a win, lose, or draw condition.
Display the result and ask if the players want to play again.
